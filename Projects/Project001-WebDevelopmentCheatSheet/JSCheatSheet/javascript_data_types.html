            <h2>Definition</h2>
            <p>In programming, a data type is a classification that specifies which type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, relational, or logical operations can be applied to it without causing an error. JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means you don't have to declare the data type of a variable. The JavaScript engine determines the data type of a variable at runtime.</p>

            <h2>Detailed classification of primitive and non-primitive data types</h2>
            <p>JavaScript data types are divided into two main categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Primitive Data Types:</b> These are the most basic data types in JavaScript. They are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once created. They are stored directly in the location that the variable accesses. There are seven primitive data types: String, Number, BigInt, Boolean, Undefined, Null, and Symbol.</li>
                <li><b>Non-Primitive Data Types (Reference Types):</b> These data types can hold collections of values and more complex entities. They are mutable, and their values are stored as a reference in memory. The primary non-primitive data type is the <strong>Object</strong>, which includes special object types like <strong>Array</strong> and <strong>Function</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Explain Primitive Datatypes With proper example.</h2>
            <h3>String</h3>
            <p>The String data type is used to represent textual data. It is a sequence of characters enclosed in single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`).</p>
            <pre><code>let greeting = "Hello, World!";
let name = 'Alice';</code></pre>

            <h3>Number</h3>
            <p>The Number data type represents both integer and floating-point numbers. It also includes special values like `Infinity`, `-Infinity`, and `NaN` (Not-a-Number).</p>
            <pre><code>let age = 30;
let price = 19.99;
let temperature = -5.5;</code></pre>

            <h3>Boolean</h3>
            <p>The Boolean data type represents a logical entity and can have one of two values: `true` or `false`.</p>
            <pre><code>let isLoggedIn = true;
let hasPermission = false;</code></pre>

            <h3>Undefined</h3>
            <p>A variable that has not been assigned a value has the value `undefined`. It is a primitive value automatically assigned to variables that have just been declared.</p>
            <pre><code>let score;
console.log(score); // Outputs: undefined</code></pre>

            <h3>Null</h3>
            <p>The Null type has exactly one value: `null`. It represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used to signify that a variable has no value.</p>
            <pre><code>let user = null;</code></pre>

            <h3>Symbol</h3>
            <p>Introduced in ES6, a Symbol is a unique and immutable primitive value that may be used as the key of an Object property. Every Symbol value returned from `Symbol()` is unique.</p>
            <pre><code>const id1 = Symbol('id');
const id2 = Symbol('id');
console.log(id1 === id2); // Outputs: false</code></pre>

            <h3>BigInt</h3>
            <p>BigInt is a numeric primitive in JavaScript that can represent integers with arbitrary precision. BigInts are created by appending `n` to the end of an integer or by calling the `BigInt()` constructor.</p>
            <pre><code>const bigNumber = 9007199254740991n;
const anotherBigNumber = BigInt("9007199254740992");</code></pre>

            <h2>Differentiate between null and undefined with some examples.</h2>
            <p>While both `null` and `undefined` represent the absence of a value, they are used in different contexts.</p>

            <h2>Explain Mutable and immutable and differentiate between them.</h2>
            <p><b>Immutable</b> data types are those whose values cannot be changed after they are created. When you perform an operation that seems to modify an immutable value, you are actually creating a new value in memory. All primitive data types in JavaScript are immutable.</p>
            <p><b>Mutable</b> data types are those whose values can be changed in place, after they are created. Non-primitive data types (objects, arrays) are mutable.</p>

            <h3>Example with an Immutable (Primitive) Type:</h3>
            <pre><code>let str = "hello";
str[0] = "H"; // This will not cause an error, but it won't change the string
console.log(str); // Outputs: "hello"

let newStr = str.toUpperCase();
console.log(newStr); // Outputs: "HELLO"
console.log(str); // Outputs: "hello" (original string is unchanged)</code></pre>

            <h3>Example with a Mutable (Non-Primitive) Type:</h3>
            <pre><code>let person = { name: "John", age: 30 };
person.age = 31;
console.log(person); // Outputs: { name: "John", age: 31 }

const colors = ["red", "green"];
colors.push("blue");
console.log(colors); // Outputs: ["red", "green", "blue"]</code></pre>
